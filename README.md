This project is meant to serve as practice with HTML/CSS.

In this case, since it is an example, I left all links as list elements. Should I want to change this,
I would simply put the values inside of <a> tags.

This page is also missing some of the interactive elements, as I have yet to reach the JavaScript/jQuery section of The Odin Project.

The only element that is completely missing is the microphone inside of the search bar - this is because I did not have access
to the appropriate glyphicon so that I couldn't link to the image url in my css.

If I had the url, I would have used the background element.
